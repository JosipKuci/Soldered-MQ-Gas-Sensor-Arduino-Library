Gas sensor registers the presence of various gases, such as oil and gasoline vapors, butane, propane, methane, ethanol(alcohol), hydrogen, smoke. It registers gases the best while they are in the liquid form, but since we cannot find them in that state that often, it measures a good concentration of substances in a gaseous state. It takes a short time to heat up in order to work correctly.

The breakout board works with both digital (DO) and analog signals (AO). The digital output is obtained by setting a threshold value with a potentiometer. The analog output will differ depending on the intensity of the gas.

- Voltage: 5V
- Digital(HIGH/LOW) and analog(0V-5V) output
- With LM393 comparator
- Dimensions: 22 x 38 mm

Have you ever wondered how much natural gas and methane are in your living room? You can easily measure that! The MQ4 breakout board is a simple-to-use sensor that detects the natural gas and methane (CH4) in the air. Once heated to working temperature, it detects changes in air concentrations very quickly between 200 and 10000 ppm.

On the through-holes, the DO stands for digital out and AO for analog out. The digital output is obtained by setting a threshold value using the potentiometer. The analog output will depend on the intensity of the gas around the sensor.

Gas sensor MQ7 detects the presence of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the air. The best results are given when alcohol is in liquid form, however, it still does an amazing job when measuring in gas form. It needs a bit of time to warm up in order to work correctly.

The breakout board works with both digital (DO) and analog signals (AO). The digital output is obtained by setting a threshold value with a potentiometer. The analog output will differ depending on the intensity of the gas.

| [Hydrogen sensor MQ8 breakout](https://www.solde.red/333108)  

Hydrogen is all around us, and it’s very flammable. Its leakage can be very dangerous to both life and property. That’s why it's important to detect any leakage to prevent in the industry. To help with that, hydrogen sensors like the MQ8 breakout board are used. The sensor detects hydrogen at the range of 100-1000 ppm.

The digital and analog outs are on the breakout through-hole pins. They are marked as DO and AO respectively. By setting a threshold value with a potentiometer, you can get the digital output. The analog output will depend on how much gas is detected around the sensor.

We are surrounded by invisible gases everywhere. While we generally don’t have to worry about them, under the right circumstances, they can be very combustible and dangerous. The MQ9 breakout board detects carbon monoxide, methane, propane, and other flammable gases so the right measures can be taken in time. The sensor detects carbon monoxide at 10-1000 ppm and other combustible gasses at 100-10000 ppm.

The digital and analog outs can be found on the through-holes. They are marked as DO and AO respectively. The digital output can be obtained by setting a threshold value with a potentiometer. The analog output will depend on the intensity of the gases.

| [Ozone sensor MQ131 breakout](https://www.solde.red/333110)    

This breakout for the MQ131 sensor responds to the presence of ozone in the air. As the ozone concentration increases, the resistance changes and the ozone concentration can be measured by measuring the analogue output voltage. The sensor is of good precision and is normally used in ozone concentration detectors. There is a 3362 potentiometer on the board with which the digital signal threshold can be set. There is a digital and analogue output via the male pins.
