// Include the library
#include <MQ-Sensor-SOLDERED.h>

#define numOfCalibrations 10 //How many readings of R0 we take to get average measurement

//Create an instance of the sensor object
MQ138 mq138; 

void setup()
{
    // Init the serial port communication at 115200 bauds. It's used to print out measured data.
    Serial.begin(115200);

    // Explanation:
    // In this routine the sensor will measure the resistance of the sensor after it has been pre-heated for 48h
    // and now is in a clean air enviorment, and it will setup the R0 value.
    // This routine not need to execute on every restart, you can load your R0 into flash memory and read it on startup
    
    Serial.print("Calibrating please wait.");
